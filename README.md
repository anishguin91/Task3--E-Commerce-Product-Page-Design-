# Description of task:  As part of my internship at Codtech IT Solutions, the third task assigned to me was to design a high-quality e-commerce product page for a clothing item, specifically a T-shirt. The goal of this task was to create a user-friendly, visually appealing, and conversion-optimized layout that mimics the experience of a real-world shopping platform.

Research & Planning
Before starting the design, I researched top e-commerce websites like Amazon, Myntra, and H&M to understand how they present product information, manage layout hierarchy, and guide users toward making a purchase. I identified common UI patterns such as product image galleries, price sections, customer reviews, delivery options, and CTAs (Call to Actions) like “Add to Cart” and “Wishlist.”

My goal was to create a clean, intuitive, and conversion-focused interface that aligns with user expectations and provides all necessary information at a glance.

Design Execution
I designed a product page for a “Roadster” Regular Fit Round-Neck T-shirt. The layout I created includes:

Product Image Gallery

A large high-quality image of the T-shirt with slider arrows for viewing additional angles.

Positioned prominently on the left to immediately grab user attention.

Product Information Section

Product title, category, and rating with a visual star indicator and total number of reviews.

Clearly displayed price along with the original MRP, a discount badge, and tax-inclusion note.

Available color (Dark Grey) and selectable sizes (S, M, L, XL) with a size chart link.

Primary CTAs

A standout “Add to Cart” button and a secondary “Wishlist” button.

Clear and accessible placement to increase purchase and engagement likelihood.

Delivery & Return Information

Delivery options with time estimates and cost details.

Easy return policy highlights with free store return and USPS drop-off support.

Trust badges for accepted payment methods (Visa, Mastercard, PayPal) for user assurance.

Product Details & Material Information

Clear breakdown of Material (100% Premium Cotton), Fit (Regular), and Care Instructions.

An expandable section offering more in-depth details about comfort, fabric quality, and durability.

Customer Reviews Section

Star rating average (4.7 stars from 120 verified buyers) with a visual rating distribution bar.

Three highlighted reviews showcasing verified user feedback including helpful upvote, report, and interaction buttons.

Emphasized keywords like “Soft, Stylish, and Durable” for trust-building.

Related Products Carousel

Horizontally scrollable section featuring similar T-shirts with ratings, prices, and discount tags.

Helps increase cross-selling opportunities and retain user engagement.

Footer Design

Structured footer with quick links to Help, FAQ, Delivery & Returns, and Blog.

Contact details and social media icons.

App download badges for iOS and Android.

Tools & Techniques
I used Figma for layout design, applying design principles like visual hierarchy, spacing, contrast, and modular UI. I followed an 8-point grid system to ensure consistency and responsiveness. I ensured accessibility standards were met by using readable fonts, proper contrast, and intuitive button sizes.

Outcome & Learnings
This task helped me improve in several key areas:

E-commerce UX principles: I learned how to structure information in a way that boosts user confidence and encourages conversions.

Micro-interactions and consistency: From button hover states to section padding, I focused on maintaining a cohesive visual system.

User empathy: I anticipated user questions (e.g., fit, delivery, return) and answered them directly in the UI.

Trust-building design: I realized how crucial reviews, secure payment visuals, and clear return policies are in influencing buyer decisions.

Overall, this task allowed me to create a professional and user-centric e-commerce product page while strengthening my design thinking and UI execution skills.
